Solved flickering by making sure that the camera position is updated only when instance data is also updated.

- Working on particle issue. Regardless of particle settings, there is _sometimes_ an extra blue square that gets rendered
    at the players location+rotation.
- The more particles that exist at once, the more likely this will appear.
- I think it's because the draw call for blue squares is picking up the player entity data, maybe because the # of
    particles is off, and it grabs the next data available which happens to be the player
- The extra square ONLY appears while entity count is increasing!!!
