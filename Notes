Major rework of Dyn4J for generics.

TODO
- It looks like teamfilter isn't working between enemy ships? They shouldn't be colliding. Debugger not pausing on TeamFilter.isAllowed() breakpoint
- Clean up the confusing dataclasses (GraphicalData/RenderableComponent)
- Clean up the references to color values (introduce a Color class?)
- Make broken parts fall off as effects particles
- Figure out a way to regenerate parts in a realistic order (inner -> outer as opposed to FIFO queue)
- Make the background effect stretch with camera speed

- POC Client<->Server ???
