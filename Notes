Get working on making the splitting function

TODO
- Clean up the confusing dataclasses (GraphicalData/RenderableComponent)
- Clean up the references to color values (introduce a Color class?)
- Make broken parts fall off as effects particles
- Figure out a way to regenerate parts in a realistic order (inner -> outer as opposed to FIFO queue)
- Make the background effect stretch with camera speed
- Make it fail gracefully when you hit the exit button!

- POC Client<->Server ???

= Confirmed that fixture removal/revival and collisions/breaking still work
