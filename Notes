Get working on making the splitting function

TODO
- Clean up the confusing dataclasses (GraphicalData/RenderableComponent)
- Clean up the references to color values (introduce a Color class?)
- Add some fun effects
- Figure out a way to regenerate parts in a realistic order (inner -> outer as opposed to FIFO queue)
- Clean up camera stuff, allow manual movement
- Setup code to go from mouse click to world space
- Make it fail gracefully when you hit the exit button!
-

- POC Client<->Server ???

= Confirmed that fixture removal/revival and collisions/breaking still work
